/** Defects in sconfig itself, reproduced with a bare parse-render round trip: no include masking
  * and no other code of ours is involved.
  *
  * The division of labour in this project is that everything except `include` handling is the
  * library's job. So these are not ours to fix in `HoconFormatter` - they are upstream bugs, and
  * all `HoconFormatter` does about them is refuse to emit the result (see
  * `HoconSpecCoverageSpec`).
  *
  * Each test asserts what sconfig *should* do, so it is RED while the bug is open. They are
  * therefore excluded from `sbt test` and from CI, and run on demand, on every platform, since
  * sconfig's Scala.js and Scala Native builds have defects of their own:
  *
  * {{{ sbt libraryDefects }}}
  *
  * When a future sconfig release fixes one, its test turns green - that is the signal to drop the
  * corresponding refusal from `HoconFormatter` and the note from CLAUDE.md.
  *
  * Examples are taken from the HOCON specification.
  * @see
  *   https://github.com/lightbend/config/blob/main/HOCON.md
